# nodejs-project

This project was written during my study on Node.Js course. I created an app where user after registration can login into application and made some requests with params and get a result. Also user can store some files in storage.

For frontend development I used stack of technologies such as Angular12, TypeScript, Angular material, Bootstrap4, SCSS.

For backend development I used stack of technologies such as Node.Js, Express, MongoDb, Nginx, AWS.

On AWS due some internal rules and difficulties to folow them I cut some functionality like a websockets and email sending.
But on my studying server all these functionalities work without limitation
